# JSwiki
JSwiki is (going to be) a wiki based on javascript and able to run without any kind of webserver, but just on your local machine.

## Comparison to TiddlyWiki
You might think: "Hey, there is such a thing already. It's called TiddlyWiki". Well, yes, and I'm not a great fan of it. It's got all this animation stuff, and tries to do all on one page, in one file. And while I'm sure there's some amazing use-cases for that and there are people who can't live without it, I want something different.

## Features
* Javascript + HTML + CSS
* Pages are stored in files. One page, one file.
  * You should be able to edit those files without opening the wiki, but do the editing in your favorite text editor
* $imagination
